## UNIX Silent Installation

Need to create a `cd_srvr` cnfiguration file.

```
cdai_installCmd=install
cdai_installDir=/apps/cdunix/
cdai_localNodeName=aix.d**t
cdai_acquireHostnameOrIP=GB**SR00**N0*
cdai_serverPort=1364
cdai_clientPort=1363
cdai_localCertFile=/apps/cdunix/install/aix.d**t_keycert
cdai_adminUserid=cdadmin
cdai_trace=y
```
#### CD Configuration File “/apps/cdunix/silent_install/cd_srvr”

Create a `cd_fa` configuration file if FileAgent needs to be installed.

```
INSTALLER_UI=Console
USER_INSTALL_DIR=/apps/cdunix/file_agent
USER_INSTALL_DIR_SET=YES
```
#### FA Configuration File “/apps/cdunix/silent_install/cd_fa”

Use the below commands to install and start the application.

```bash
# Command ro extract the installation script from binary file - cdinstall
# Extract | Verbose | Create Directory | Modification Time | Buffer Size
cpio –ivdmB < /apps/cdunix/install/cdinstall /apps/cdunix/install/cdinstall_a

# Command to Install
/apps/cdunix/install/cdinstall_a –f /usr/sfg/install/cd_srvr

# Sterling Connect Direct startup command
su cdadmin -c "/apps/cdunix/ndm/bin/cdpmgr -i /apps/cdunix/ndm/cfg/aix.test/initparm.cfg &"

# Sterling Connect Direct File Agent startup command
su cdadmin -c "nohup /apps/cdunix/file_agent/cdfa -c /apps/cdunix/file_agent/aix.test.ser > /dev/null &"
```

## Windows Installation
- **Logon locally**: Needs to be a local User.
- **Replace Level Token**: Submit process on behalf of the user.
- **Act as part of OS**: Helps Authenticate & Impersonate CD users.

## SecurePlus

GSK commands to check if the KDB is still working and the list of certs it already has.

```bash
# Export GSK Lib path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install_dir/ndm/lib/gsk/lib
export LIBPATH=/install_dir/ndm/lib/gsk/lib

# Verify Password
/install_dir/ndm/lib/gsk/lib/gsk8capicmd -keydb -stashpw \
    -db /install_dir/ndm/secure+/certificates/cdketstore.kdb \
    -pw password_kdb

# Check cert list in KDB
/install_dir/ndm/lib/gsk/lib/gsk8capicmd -cert -list \
    -db /install_dir/ndm/secure+/certificates.cdketstore.kdb -stashed

# Check cert details using label name
/install_dir/ndm/lib/gsk/lib/gsk8capicmd -cert -details \
    -label "rhel.test" \
    -db /install_dir/ndm/secure+/certificates.cdketstore.kdb -stashed
```

Import new cert into KDB using `spcli.sh`

```bash
cd /install_dir/ndm/bin/
./spcli.sh

# Command to import Key Cert
SPCLI> Import KeyCert
    File="/install_dir/ndm/secure+/certificates/keycert_2024.txt"
    Passphrase=password_cert
    Label=rhel.test_2024;

# COmmand to import Trusted Cert
SPCLI> Import TrustedCert
    File="/install_dir/ndm/secure+/certificates/keycert_2024.txt"
    ImportMode=Add;

# Finally update the Local Node to reference the new cert label
SPCLI> Update LocalNode
    Override=Y
    KeyCertLabel=rhel.test_2024;
```

## Open `direct` prompt
```bash
export NDMAPICFG=/install_dir/ndm/cfg/cliapi/ndmapi.cfg
/install_dir/ndm/bin/direct
```

## Command to Change a CDP
```bash
CHANGE PROCESS 
WHERE (NODE, PNAME, PNUM, SUB)
DEST
HOLD = Yes | No | Call
RELEASE
RETAIN = Yes | No | InitialSTARTT
```

## Use FLUSH command to remove a CDP in execution stage
```bash
FLUSH PROC
WHERE (PNAME, PNUM, SUB)
```

## Remove a CDP not in execution stage
```bash
DELETE PROC
WHERE (PNAME, PNUM, SUB)
```

## Select Statement to query the CDP
```bash
SEL STAT
WHERE (CCODE, PNAME, PNUM, STATT, SNODE, FNAME)
```

## DISP parameter for mainframe nodes?
- NEW | OLD | MOD | RPL | SHR, (Stats)
- KEEP | CATLG, (if process completes successfully)
- KEEP | CATLG | DELETE (if process ends abruptly)

> Default Client Port `1363` and Server Port `1364`

## What are the important parameters in netmap.cfg?
- `comm.info`: contains remote nodes IP/ DNS and Port `1364`
- `alternate.comminfo`: to be configured with multiple IPs and Ports for the Pnode which can initiate connection with more than one IP address. This is required when Netmap Check is turned on.
- `alt.comm`.outbound: to be configured with multiple IPs and Ports for Snodes with multiple NIC cards, when Snode can listen to multiple IP addresses. Pnode will try to connect all the IPs configured in this parameter.
- `outgoing.address`: to be configured with Virtual IP of the Snode when it's running on HA/ cluster configuration. This is required when Netmap Check is turned on.

| Operating System | Version |
| --- | --- |
| CD of Unix	| 4.2.0.4_iFix56 |
| CD of Windows |	4.8.03 |

## TCQ: Transmission Control Queue
- Hold - When hold is yes during execution or process is in error state
- Timer - `STARTT` is mentioned or if process in retry state
- Wait - Process is waiting for a session to be executed
- Execution - When the file is being transferred

## Transfer b/w unix and windows via CD
Default datatype for UNIX and all other cd nodes is text except Windows. Default datatype for Windows is binary

- `xlate=yes` is default for text file transfer
- `xlate=no` is default for binary file transfer

For file transfer b/w two ASCII nodes like UNIX and Windows it is recommended to add datatype=binary in both from and to part of the copy statement. This ensures that there is no data translation and the file is transferred as it is.

> In Mainframe the datatype is EBSIDIC. For more information chekcout out [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-specify-sysopts-copy-between-ascii-platforms) around this topic.
