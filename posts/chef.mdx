## Components

- **Chef Workstation**: Server where the Chef SDK is installed and developer creates cookbooks, recipes and tests in the kitchen.
- **Chef Server** stores all the configurations for Chef Node to pull.
- **Chef Nodes** configure them selfs by pulling the configuration from the Chef Server and this process is called convergence.

## Benefits of using a CM Tool

- **Idempotent**: you can run the script over and over again to ensure that the application is in desired state without any undesirable side effects.
- **Easy compatibility** with any Cloud Service Provider like AWS, GCP, etc.

# Creating and Running first Recipe

Check out [Vagrant](https://ajesh-mishra.github.io/blog/vagrant) on how to set-up a VM.


```ruby
directory '/test/' do
	mod '0755'
	user 'root'
	group 'root'
	action :create
end

file './hello.txt' do
	content 'Hello World!'
	mode '0644'
	owner 'root'
	group 'root'
	action :create
end
```

#### hello-world.rb

`directory` and `file` are resources and `content`, `mode`, `owner` are the properties.

Chef resource is a “statement of configuration policy”. It describes the desired state of the element of your infrastructure and the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state.

```bash
# Command to run the recipe locally
sudo chef-client --local-mode hello-world.rb
```

## Cookbook

```bash
# Command to generate a cookbook
chef generate cookbook cookbooks/apache

# Use the help flag to discover more options
chef generate --help

# Generating a recipe
chef generate recipe <path-to-cookbook> <name-of-recipe>
chef generate recipe ~/cookbooks/apache server

# Executing recipe with the runlist option
sudo chef-client --local-mode --runlist "recipe[apache::server]"

# Short hand for above command, order of the flags is important
sudo chef-client -zr "recipe[apache::server]"

# If a recipe is not specified the default recipe will be executed
sudo chef-client -zr "recipe[apache]"
```

`metadata.rb` file has the version of the cookbook and the maintainers contact details.

Recipes Directory has `default.rb` which can include one or more recipes located in the cookbook using the `include_recipe` method.

```ruby
include_recipe 'apache::server'
```
#### ~/cookbooks/apache/recipes/default.rb

## Examples

```ruby
package "httpd" do
	action :install
end

file "/var/www/html/index.html" do
	content "<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		ipaddress: #{node['ipaddress']}
		hostname: #{node['hostname']}"
	action :create
end

service "httpd" do
	action :start
end
```
#### Web Server Deployment “~/cookbooks/apache/recipes/server.rb”


```ruby
service 'ntp' do
	action [ :enable, :start ]
end
```
#### Network Time Protocol

## Templates

```bash
chef generate template --help
chef generate template <path-to-cookbook> <name-of-template>

# Generates a embeded ruby file in the 
# ~/cookbooks/apache/templetes/index.html.erb
chef generate template ~/cookbooks/apache index.html
```
We can extract the html from our server.rb recipe, place it in the index.html.erb templete and update it to use erb template. Now that we have a template we can modify the recipe to use it.

```ruby
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
ipaddress: <%= node['ipaddress'] %>
hostname: <%= node['hostname'] %>
```
#### ~/cookbooks/apache/templetes/index.html.erb

```ruby
template "/var/www/html/index.html" do
	source 'index.html.erb'
end
```
#### ~/cookbooks/apache/recipes/server.rb

## Variables in Chef

```ruby
['database']['user'] = "myDBuser"
['database']['passwd'] = "myPassword"
```
#### Declaring Variables

```ruby
file 'C:\ProgramData\my.ini' do
	content "
		user=#{['database']['user']}
		password=#{['database']['passwd']}
	"
	rights :read, 'Everyone'
end
```
#### Reference Variables

## Ohai

This is a command line tool that gives us information about the server in a json format. We can access the various system resources in our recipes using the `node` object as `chef-client` executes ohai and stores all the values in it.

```ruby
node['ipaddress']
node['hostname']
node['memory']['total']
node['cpu']['0']['mhz']
```

# Knife Commands

`knife` commands help you communicate with Chef Server from chef-client.
```bash
# All options
knife client --help

# Lists your organization and confirms that you are authenticated
# to the chef server.
knife client --list

# Command lets you upload and query cookbooks in the Chef Server
knife cookbook -help

# Lists all the cookbook in Chef Server
knife cookbook list

# Commands to manage Chef nodes
knife node --help
knife node list              # Lists all the nodes managed by chef server.
knife node show <node_name>  # shows config related to the node like runlist.
knife node show <node_name> -a ipaddress    # -a stands for Attributes like ip.
knife node show <node_name> -a cloud    # Public and Private IP address of EC2.
```
Adding a new node to the chef server is called bootstrapping, here are the related commands:
```bash
knife bootstrap --help
knife bootstrap FQDN\                           # Fully Qulified Domain Name
							  -x USER -P PWD\                 # User ID and Password
								--sudo\                         # Run with sudo previlages
								-N node_name\                   # Give it a name
								-r "recipe[apache::server]".    # What recipe to execute
```
Nodes execute sudo chef-client to sync the policies in the chef server.

## Steps for Deployment

- Install Chef tools on the nodes.
- Transferring the Apache cookbook to Chef Server using `knife cookbook upload` command.
- Applying the Runlist using the `knife bootstrap` command.


# Test deployments with Kitchen

Configuration file for the kitchen is present in `~/cookbook/apache/.kitchen.yml` file.
```yaml
---
driver:
	name: vagrant

provisioner:
	name: chef_zero

verifier:
	name: inspec

platforms:
	- name: ubuntu-16.04
	- name: centos-7.2

suites:
	- name: default
		run_list:
			- recipe[apache::default]
		verifier:
			inspec_tests:
				- test/recipes
		attributes:
```
inspec is the testing framework deigned by Chef.

## Kitchen Commands

```yaml
kitchen create     # Creates a VM defined in driver.
kitchen converge   # Install Chef Tools, copies and apply cookbooks
                   # defined in provisioner.
kitchen verify     # Uses the default_test.rb to test the VM's state.
kitchen destroy    # Destroyes the VM.
kitchen login      # Login into the VM.
```

## Automated Testing

```ruby
describe port(80) do
	it { should be_listening }
end

describe command('curl localhost') do
	its(:stdout) { should match(/Hello, World!/) }
end
```

#### ~/cookbooks/apache/test/recipes/default_test.rb

## Rake Command
```bash
# To check the syntax
rake cop

# To check the local code
rake unit

# To test code in remote and create a virtual machine
rake libvirt -- -k'converge' -u x0134742
```

## Wrapper Cookbook

Update the `metadata.rb` file to define the cookbooks you are dependent on.

```bash
name 'myhaproxy'
maintainer 'Ajesh Mishra'
maintainer_email 'ajesh.mishra@gmail.com'
license 'all_rights'
long_description 'Installs/ Configures myhaproxy'
version '0.1.0'

depends 'haproxy' '= 1.6.7'
```
#### ~/cookbooks/myhaproxy/metadata.rb

Update your `default.rb` recipe file to use the parent cookbook’s attribute and finally include it.
```ruby
node.default['haproxy']['members'] = [
	{
		'hostname' => 'localhost',
		'ipadress' => '127.0.0.1',
		'port' => 4000,
		'ssl_port' => 4000
	},
	{
		'hostname' => 'localhost',
		'ipadress' => '127.0.0.1',
		'port' => 4001,
		'ssl_port' => 4001
	}
]

include_recipe 'haproxy::default'
```
#### default.rb

## Berkshelf

Berkshelf is a cookbook management tool that allows you to upload your cookbook and all of it’s dependencies to the Chef Server.

`Berksfile` is the configuration file for the Berksshelf tool.

```ruby
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'
metadata
```

#### ~/cookbooks/myhaproxy/Berksfile

Use the berks install command to install all the dependencies locally. All the dependencies will be downloaded in the ~/.berkshelf/cookbooks/ directory.

```bash
# Install all the deoendencies of you cookbook
berks install

# Upload all the cookbooks to the Chef Server.
berks upload
```

## Server Artifacts

In addition to storing cookbooks, the Chef Server can also hold additional pieces of policy called artifacts that nodes can utilise for more specific configurations.

These include `roles`, `environments` and `data bags`.

## Role

A role describes a run list of the recipes that are executed on the node. A role may define new defaults or overrides for existing cookbook atribute value.

When you assign a role to a node, you do so in it’s run list.

```ruby
name 'web'
description 'Web Server'
run_list 'recipe[apache]'
```

#### ~/chef-repo/roles/web.rb

Now after defining roles, you can use roles to bootstrap nodes instead of recipes.

```bash
knife bootstrap FQDN -x USER -P PWD --sudo -N node_name\                           
				    -r "role[web]".    # What recipe to execute
```
## Environments
```ruby
name 'production'
description 'Where we run production code'

cookbook 'apache' '= 0.1.0'
cookbook 'myhaproxy' '= 0.1.0'
```
#### ~/chef-repo/environments/production.rb

## Data Bags

A data bag is a container of items that represent information in `json` format about your infrastructure that is not tied to a single node.

```bash
# Use knife command to see the information in data bag
knife search users "id:bobo"
```
This information is also accessible from recipe, like below. We are looping through the users data bag and creating them.

```bash
search("users", "*.*").each do |user_data|
	user user_data["id"] do
		comment user_data["comment"]
		uid user_data["uid"]
		gid user_data["gid"]
		home user_data["home"]
		shell user_data["shell"]
	end
end
```
#### user.rb
