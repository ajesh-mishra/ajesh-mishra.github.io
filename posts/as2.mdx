## Features of AS2

- It uses `HTTPS` to protocol to transfer messages with the `POST` method.
- Partners particitating in AS2 message exchange have a GLN (Global Location Number) which is a 13-digit number that uniquely identifies a company.
- AS2 uses the `S/MIME` protocol to wrap EDI data in a secure "envelope" and send it over the web.
- AS2 does not specify the file contents but usually, the file contents are in a standardized format that is separately agreed upon, such as `X12`, `XML` or `EDIFACT`.
- `MDN` (Message Disposition Notification) is an electronic acknowledgement sent from receiver to sender which confirm that the AS2 message was received.

> Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) is a supplementary protocol that allows non-ASCII data to be sent through SMTP. It supports audio, video, images among many other data format.

## Benifites of MDN

- Ensures Data Integrity.
- Whether the transfer was successful.
- If the message was sent to correct recipient.
