## EBS Volume - Elastic Block Store
Itâ€™s a Network Drive that can be attached to an Instance.
- Persists data even after instance is terminated.
- Can be mounted to a single instance at a time. Except for `io1` and `io2` volume types.
- Locked to a specific to Availability Zone.

>ðŸ’¡ At the time of provisioning, one has to decide the [Capacity]() and whether to turn on [Delete on Termination]()

## EBS Snapshots
Taking backup of the volume

- Itâ€™s not necessary to detach the volume but recommended while taking snapshots.
- During Snapshots creation you can select a different Availability Zones, this helps copy volumes.

Features:
- [EBS Snapshot Archive]() (*takes 24 -72 hours to retrieve*)
- [Recycle Bin]() (*Retention Rule can be from 1 day to 1 year*)

## EC2 Image Builder

## EC2 Instance Store
Physical disk space that are available in the EC2 Instanceâ€™s Physical server can be attached to the EC2 as Instance Store.
- High Performance
- Ephemeral - lost when instance is terminated

>ðŸ’¡ A use case would be to use it as a [Cache]().

## EFS Elastic File System

This is a Managed NFS (Network File System) which can be connected to 100s of EC2 Instances across Availability Zones.

>ðŸ’¡ [EFS Infrequent Access]() is 92% cheaper than Standard EFS for files that are not accessed daily based on a [Lifecycle Policy]().

## Amazon FSx

Extended NFS, helps us use other storage systems other than EFS and EBS.
