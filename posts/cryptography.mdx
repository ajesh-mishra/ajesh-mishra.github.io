Cryptographic keys can be stored in PKI (Public Key Infrastructures) and Smart Card which we use to securely unlock doors in a building.

TPM - Trusted Platform Module is a firmware that can store cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt entire disc volumes. TPM can also store information about the start-up sequence on a machine and also detect if it has been tampered with.

Token devices both hardware and software based.

## Symmetric Key Encryption

Symmetric encyrption uses a single secret key to both encrypt and decrypt data. Examples of symetric key algorithms:

| Algorithm Name | Max Key Size in Bits |
| --- | --- |
| AES | 256 |
| RC4 | 2048 |
| 3DES | 168 |
| Blowfish | 448 |

## Asymmetric/ Public Key Encryption

Asymmetric Encryption uses two mathematically related keys, a public and a provate key. Examples of asymmetric algorithms:

| Algorithm Name | Max Key Size in Bits |
| --- | --- |
| RSA | 4096 |
| Diffie-Hellman | n/a |
| ElGamal | 2048 |
| ECC | 256 |

Sender uses public key of the recipient to encrypt data and the recipient uses the corresponding private key to decrypt the data.

> Hash is an Algorithm which is only used to encrypt and the message digest can't be decrypted. (e.g. SHA-1 and MD5)

# How does a Hash work?

- Pads the message with random data.
- Encrypts the message.
- Takes finite number of bytes to form a finger print.

> Hash can also be used to check data integrity during a transfer. Meaning if the data has been tampered during the transfer.

# What is a Cipher?

Cipher is the mechanism how the algorithm would be used to encrypt the data (e.g. Block and Streams ciphers).

- Block cipher - e.g. `DES`, `3DES`, `AES`, `IDEA`
- Stream cipher - e.g. `RC4` used in SSL.

## How does Block cipher work?

- Uses **Initialisation Vector** (IV) and **Cipher Block Chaining**  (CBC).
- **Xor IV** and 1st chunk of message and encrypt it with a key from the key table
- **Xor** result/ digest and 2nd chunk of message and encrypt it

## What is DES?

Digital Encryption Standard (obsolete now) uses a 56 bit key to create a key table. And then a key from the key table is used to encrypt data.

> 3DES just uses 3 different keys one after the other to perform the operation 3 times.


- **IDEA** - International Data Encryption Algorithm. Uses 128 bit key to generate 56 keys each of 16 bits.
- **AES** - Advanced Encryption Standard.
