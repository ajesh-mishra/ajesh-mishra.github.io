- Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
- Scalability vs Elasticity vs Agility

>ðŸ’¡ Elasticity is a cloud native term which refers to the ability to adapt based on load. Example **Auto Scaling Group**

## Elastic Load Balancer
There are 3 major types of load balancer:

**Application**
- Layer 7
- Http or Https or gRCP
- Static DNS / URL

**Network**

- Layer 4
- TCP or UDP or TLS
- Ultra High Performance
- Static IP using Elastic IP

**Gateway**

- Layer 3
- GENEVE Protocol
- Intrusion Detection


>ðŸ’¡ [Classic Load Balancer](): Retired in 2023 (Layer 4 & 7)

## Auto Scaling Group

- [Launch Template](): Similar to the widget used for creating EC2.
- [Target Group](): EC2s created are linked to a Load Balancer.

## ASG Strategies

- [Manual]()
- [Dynamic](): Respond to changing demand.

| Strategy Type | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| Simple Step Scaling |	Up scale or down scale based on CPU Usage when Cloud Watch alarm is triggered. |
| Target Tracking Scaling |	Average CPU to be around 40% |
| Scheduled | Scaling	Based on Usage Pattern |
| Predictive Scaling |	Use ML and previous usage data to predict |
