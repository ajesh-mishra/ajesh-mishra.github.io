## How FTPS works?

- Client sends `AUTH TLS` or `AUTH SSL` command to encrypt the **Command Channel** with `TLS` or `SSL`.
- **Server** and **Client** Validation happens using `X.509` certificates as it would in TLS.
- `PBSZ` (Protected Buffer Size) Buffer Size of the protocol used to encrypt the Data. Zero for TLS.
- To encrypt and protect **Data Channel** client send `PROT` command.
- `CCC` (Clear Control Channel) and `CDC` (Clear Data Channel) commands can be used any time during the session to stop encryption on either of the channels.

| Protocol | Control/ Command Port | Data Port |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| FTP | 21 | 20 |
| FTPS | 990 | 989 |


## Types of FTPS Connections

- **Implicit**: Mandates to secure both Data and Control channels, hence SSL handshake and Authorization command is necessary even before any FTP command is transferred.
- **Explicit**: Client gets to decide weather to secure the channels, this was done so that non secure client's could also connect to FTPS ports eliminating the need to configure 2 FTP servers
- **Forced Explicit**: Server forces the credentials in the control channel to be secure and client may choose to secure the data channel


## Types of FTP Connections

- **Active**: Client actively issues the `PORT` command so that server can initate connection for Data Channel. This is the default.
- **Passive**: Client requests server to confirm on data port by issuing `PASV` command and then initates the connection for data channel.

## SFTP vs. FTPS

| SFTP | FTPS |
| --- | --- |
| SFTP builds on Secure Shell Protocol `SSH` and adds on file transfer capabilities. | FTPS builds on File Transfer Protocol `FTP` and adds on a security and encryption layer through `TLS`. |
| Uses a single connection through only one port, making it easier to install firewall solutions. | It needs a secondary data connection, and its use of multiple ports makes it difficult for firewalls to work. |
| Involves a high resource overhead and slows down file delivery. | It is simple, straightforward, and lean, making it several times faster. |
| Supports only binary transmission, and users cannot choose between different modes. | It supports both binary and ASCII transmissions, making it easier to maintain logs. |
| Authentication and does not need signed certificates, as the data is inherently encrypted through public-key cryptography.  | The FTP server must mandatorily provide a public-key certificate to sign off on the authentication. |
| Supports advance features like `chown`, `chmod`, `mkdir`, `mv` and `ln` on the remote system. | Supports limited features like `cd`, `ls`, `abor` and `size`.

- `abor` is to cancel a file transfer currently in progress.
- `size` fetch file size of remote file.
