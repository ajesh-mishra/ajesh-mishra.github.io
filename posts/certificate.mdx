# PKI

Public Key Infrastructure is a collection or hierarchy of digital security certificates. These certificates contain public key and sometimes mathematically related private key.

## Components of PKI

| Component Name | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Certificate Authority | Issues, renews, revokes certifcates and maintains CRL. |
| Registration Authority | Also called a subordinate of CA, should be used to manage certificates. |
| Certificate Revocation List | Verifies validity of certificates using serial number. |
| Certificate Template | Blueprint used when issuing certificates. |
| Certificate | Contains subject name, signature of CA, expiry info and public/ private key. |

> CA signs a certificate with it’s private key and this can be verified with the CA’s public key.

## Contents of Certificate

- Version Number of the Certifcate like standard `X.509`
- Serial Number
- CA digital signature and algorithms used
- Validity Period
- Subject Name like: url, email address, server name and etc
- May or may not contain a Public/ Private Key

## Certificate Signing Request

- A public and private key pair is generated
- Private key should not be shared with anyone. But sometimes they are made available to trusted parties and the process is called key escrow.
- CSR generated has the unique public key in `PKCS` format. CSR is sent to a CA for signing.

# OCSP

Online Certificate Status Protocol allows a client to query status of a specific certificate. The advantage over CRL is that the client don’t have to download the entire certificate list.

OCSP Stapling: When a certificate owner checks with CA for it’s status periodically, such as a web server with an SSL/ TLS certificate.

# Digital Signature

CA Authority uses it's own private key to encrypt the contents of the certificate, the cypher text is attached to the certificate as digital signature.

Digital Signature provides data authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. But they don’t provide data confidentiality, that is what encryption is for.

- Create a hash of the data
- Encrypt the message digest using sender’s private key which can then be verified by the recipient using sender's public key.

> Root certificates are self signed certificates. Self signed certificates are signed by their own private key.
