## Dual Authentication 

- Client is asked to check if the server is know by checking in the known host key.
- Once server is validated, client will encrypt a signature using the private key and send it to the server to verify the signature using client's public key.


## What are the parameters required for SFTP?

- **Cipher** - `3des-cbc`, `aes128-cbc`, `blowfish-cbc`.
- **MAC** (Message Authentication Codes) - `hmac-sha1`, `hmac-md5`, `hmac-sha2-256`.
- **Know Host Key** of the server.
- **User identity key** from client.

> MAC is kind of a Hash Algorithm used to verify data integrity. 

## What are the commonly used SFTP commands?

```bash
# Command to scan a SSH Host key 
ssh-keyscan -t dsa -p 22 <hostname>

# Command to create SSH Keys 
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa

# Run the below command on client to copy client user's public key 
# to authorized_keys on the server
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub user@remoteserver
```

> The file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` should have `600` permission, meaning only the user should have full permission on the file and no one else.

SFTP Commands to connect to SFTP Server.

```bash
sftp -i <path_to/private_key> user@hostname
sftp -oIdentityFile=<path_to/private_key> user@hostname
```

Alternatively, you can also create a configuration file `~/.ssh/config.sftp` and use it like `sftp -F ~/.ssh/config.sftp`.

```bash
Host remote.host.tld
User RemoteUserName
IdentityFile /path/to/atlernate/identityfile
```

> The `~/.ssh` directory should have a permission of `700`, meaning only the use should have access to this directory. 

## SFTP vs. FTPS

| SFTP | FTPS |
| --- | --- |
| SFTP builds on Secure Shell Protocol `SSH` and adds on file transfer capabilities. | FTPS builds on File Transfer Protocol `FTP` and adds on a security and encryption layer through `TLS`. |
| Uses a single connection through only one port, making it easier to install firewall solutions. | It needs a secondary data connection, and its use of multiple ports makes it difficult for firewalls to work. |
| Involves a high resource overhead and slows down file delivery. | It is simple, straightforward, and lean, making it several times faster. |
| Supports only binary transmission, and users cannot choose between different modes. | It supports both binary and ASCII transmissions, making it easier to maintain logs. |
| Authentication and does not need signed certificates, as the data is inherently encrypted through public-key cryptography.  | The FTP server must mandatorily provide a public-key certificate to sign off on the authentication. |
| Supports advance features like `chown`, `chmod`, `mkdir`, `mv` and `ln` on the remote system. | Supports limited features like `cd`, `ls`, `abor` and `size`.

- `abor` is to cancel a file transfer currently in progress.
- `size` fetch file size of remote file.
