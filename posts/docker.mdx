The idea behind a namespace is to wrap certain `global system resources` in an abstraction layer. This makes it appear like the processes within a namespace have their own isolated instance of the resource. The kernels namespace abstraction allows different groups of processes to have different views of the system.

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mnt | Mount helps create an isolated file system |
| pid | Process ID |
| net | Network |
| ipc | Interprocess Communication |
| uts | UNIX Time-sharing System allows us to unshare the domain and hostname |
| user | User ID |
| cgroup | Control Group prevents leaking host information into a namespace |

[This article provides deeper understanding of how container work under the hood](https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504).


## Namespace API

- **Clone()**: It is similar to `fork()` but allows the child process to share parts of its `execution context` with the calling process.
- **Unshare()**: enables a process to `disassociate` parts of the execution context.
- **Setns()**: This function can be used to `join` an existing namespace.
- **Proc()**: It helps populate additional filesystems specific to namespace in `/proc/$PID/ns` as a `magic` link which allows us to track if a perticular process reside in a specific namespace.

> Execution Context of a process are things like the `memory space`, the `table of file descriptors`, and the `table of signal handlers`.


## Docker Objects

- **Images**: Read-only template with instructions to create a container.
- **Containers**: It is a runnable instance of an image. From OS point of view is an isolated group of processes running on a host.
- **Volumes**: File system that can be mounted on a container.
- **Networks**


## Components of Docker

- Docker Daemon (dockerd): Listens for API requests and manages docker objects.
- Docker Client (docker): Connects to Daemon when docker commands are invoked.
- Docker Compose: 
- Docker Content Trust
- Kubernetes
- Credential Helper


## Basic Commands

- Build an Image from a Dockerfile

```bash
docker build -t hello-docker .
```

`-t` gives a tag name to this image  
`hello-world` is the name of the image  
`.` signifies present working directory where `Dockerfile` is present

- List the Image

```bash
docker image ls
```

- Run the Image as Container

```bash
docker run --name hello-docker-proc -it hello-docker
```

`hello-docker-proc` is the name of the container  
`-it` creats an interactive bash shell in the container.

- List all the Containers running

```bash
docker ps -a | grep 'hello'
```

- Clean up Containers

```bash
docker container rm hello-docker-proc
```

- Remove an Image

```bash
docker rmi -f fd484f19954f
```

## Volumes

```bash
docker volume create <volume_name>
docker volume ls
docker volume rm <volume_name>
docker volume inspect <volume_name>

# Removes all the volumes that are not referenced by any containers
docker volume prune
```

## Run

```bash
docker run -d -v hello:/world busybox ls /world
docker run  -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -i -t  ubuntu pwd
docker run -v /doesnt/exist:/foo -w /foo -i -t ubuntu bash
docker run --expose 80 ubuntu bash
docker run --env VAR1 --env VAR2 ubuntu env | grep VAR
```

## Sample Dockerfile

The below docker file demonstrates the full use of `cache` by making use of a technique called `multi-stage build` while building Docker images.

```docker
FROM node:lts as dependencies
WORKDIR /my-project
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

FROM node:lts as builder
WORKDIR /my-project
COPY . .
COPY --from=dependencies /my-project/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN npm build

FROM node:lts as runner
WORKDIR /my-project
ENV NODE_ENV production

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /my-project/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /my-project/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /my-project/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /my-project/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /my-project/package.json ./package.json

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Dockerfile


## Most Used Parameters

- **PORT**: Maps the host port to container port when two port values are provided. But if a single port value is provided then it is mapped to a random host port.

```yml
services: 
  myapp1:
  ...
  # "127.0.0.1:6060:6060/udp"
  ports:
  - target: 6060
    host_ip: 127.0.0.1
    published: 6060
    protocol: udp
    mode: host
```

#### docker-compose.yml

- **EXPOSE**: Takes a single port value and opens it up to other containers in the network. Note the port is not mapped to any host port.
- **CMD**: If arguments to `run` command is mentioned the parameters to `cmd` is ignored.
- **ENTYRPOINT**: The parameters mentioned here are appended to the arguments provide to `run` command.

## Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
    frontend:
        build: ./frontend
        ports:
            - 3000:3000
        depends_on:
            - backend
            - database

    backend:
        build: ./backend
        ports:
            - 4200:4200
        enrironment:
            DB_URL: mongodb://database/vidly
        depends_on:
            - database

    database:
        image: mongo:4.0-xenial
        ports:
            27017:27017
        volumes:
            - /opt/data/db:/data/db
        environment:
            - db-user: admin
            - db-password: password
```
